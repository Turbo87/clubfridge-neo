__Digital cash register for airsport clubs.__

![Screenshot](docs/screenshot.png)

This project is a reimplementation of the [Clubfridge](https://new.clubfridge.com/)
project, which was started in 2017 to make it easier for airsport clubs to
sell snacks and beverages to their members.

The original project was implemented with a dedicated cloud server, but these
days it is possible to save sales directly into the [Vereinsflieger](https://www.vereinsflieger.de/)
system, which is used by most airsport clubs in Germany.

The application is intended to run on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org),
so ARM cross-compilation compatibility is a requirement for any changes.
